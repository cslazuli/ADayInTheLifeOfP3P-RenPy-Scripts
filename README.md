This repository contains Ren'Py and Python scripts I wrote to create my demo project "A Day In The Life Of Persona 3 Portable". 

This is a project I made with the goal of gaining a better understanding of how to use the Ren'Py visual novel engine and Python to make a visual novel game. 

I've done this by remaking a day from the Playstation Portable remake of highly acclaimed Calendar RPG "Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3". 

This project is not for sale and should not be sold. All assets and characters used from Persona 3, Persona 3 Portable, Persona 2: Innocent Sin, and Persona Q belong to their respective owners and creators. 

My contribution is the code used to make this project run using Ren'Py and Python scripts as well as portions of original dialogue.
